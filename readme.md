Audition
========

Audition is a web-based system to allow hopeful participants in performances book and track their auditions with ease.

It is also intended as a discussion/feedback tool for creative teams with the ability to return feedback to auditionees based on their performance.

Audition was created primarily for the University of Manchester's Musical Theatre Society (UMMTS).
More info about them and the work they do can be found at http://www.ummts.co.uk.
